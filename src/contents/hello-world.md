Hi there! My name is Garret and I am a software engineer with a focus on backend development using AWS serverless technologies. I have a passion for creating scalable, efficient, and reliable software solutions and I am always looking for ways to improve my skills and knowledge in this field.

Over the years, I have gained extensive experience in working with AWS serverless technologies, including (but not limited to) Lambda, SQS, Eventbridge, and DynamoDB. I have used these tools to build a wide range of applications, from simple web services to complex data processing pipelines. I am skilled in using serverless technologies to create scalable, cost-effective solutions that can easily handle large amounts of traffic and data.

In addition to my expertise in AWS serverless technologies, I also have experience in other areas of software development, such as frontend development, database design, and DevOps. I am a strong team player and enjoy collaborating with others to find creative solutions to complex problems.
